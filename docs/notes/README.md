# Learning Notes

Student-perspective notes capturing insights, mental models, and "aha moments" from each lesson.

## Purpose

Notes reinforce learning through active engagement. They capture:
- **Key insights** - The moments concepts clicked
- **Mental models** - Visualizations and explanations in your own words
- **Misconceptions corrected** - What was initially misunderstood
- **Questions generated** - Things to explore later

## Structure

Notes mirror the lesson structure in `docs/lessons/`:

```

├── 01-getting-started/
│   ├── 01-3d-graphics-concepts.md
│   ├── 02-project-setup-and-tooling.md
│   └── 03-hello-cube.md
├── 02-scene-fundamentals/

```

## When to Write Notes

Notes are written **during** lessons, not after. This forces active engagement with the material.

## Voice

Write from the student perspective ("I learned...", "This clicked when...") not the teacher perspective.
