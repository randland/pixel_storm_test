# Tangents Queue

Interesting topics to explore when curiosity strikes. These are **not** curriculum items - they're rabbit holes worth diving into when the mood is right.

## How to Use

- Add topics as they come up during lessons
- Mark with priority: `[!]` High interest | `[~]` Medium | `[ ]` Low/someday
- When exploring, create a branch: `git checkout -b tangent/topic-name`
- After exploring, decide: merge insights back or keep as reference
